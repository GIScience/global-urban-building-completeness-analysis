# Investigating the digital divide in OpenStreetMap: spatio-temporal analysis of inequalities in global urban building completeness

Here is the python code for reproducing the analysis and figures presented in the global urban building completeness analysis manuscript. Several jupyter notebooks and python scripts are provided to run the machine learning model based on the input datasets.

### Data
Make sure to download geopackage data from HeiBox: 


### Figures and Analyses
The processing steps for the analyses can be found in the `notebooks` section. The figures are stored in the `figures` directory.

### Maps
The maps are created in [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). All relevant data files, qgis project files and styles are stored in the geopackage `data/global_urban_building_completeness.gpkg`.
